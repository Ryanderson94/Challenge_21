# Blockchain Coin Creation

In this challenge, we developed an ERC-Compliant fungible token that will serve as a monetary system for Mars. We developed, compiled and deployed smart contracts, constructors and deployers on Remix IDE.

# Technologies
This program leverages Remix IDE, on which we develop contracts in Solidity. We also used MetaMask and Ganache to similate a real-world web3 deployment.
